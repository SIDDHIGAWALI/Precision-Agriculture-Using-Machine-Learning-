Plant Growth Data Classification
A machine learning-based system for predicting optimal crop types based on soil conditions, published in IEEE ICSCSA-2024.​

📋 Overview
Agricultural productivity depends critically on matching crops to their ideal soil conditions. This project develops a classification model that recommends suitable crops based on key soil parameters:​

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels
Soil temperature (°F)
Soil pH (acidity/alkalinity)

🎯 Objective
Build an accurate predictive model to support informed agricultural decision-making by analyzing soil nutrient composition and environmental factors across 2,200 data samples covering various crops including rice, maize, legumes, fruits, and cash crops.​

🔬 Methodology
The project employs multiple machine learning algorithms:
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Bagging Classifier

📊 Dataset
2,200 samples with 8 features

Crops analyzed: Rice, maize, chickpea, kidneybeans, pigeonpeas, mothbeans, mungbean, blackgram, lentil, pomegranate, banana, mango, grapes, watermelon, muskmelon, apple, orange, papaya, coconut, cotton, jute, coffee​

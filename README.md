🌱 Plant Growth Data Classification

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify and recommend optimal plant growth conditions based on environmental and soil parameters. The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and used to train classification models that help predict the most suitable category for plant growth. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature encoding, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation. The final model aims to support smart agriculture by offering data-driven insights for better crop management.
